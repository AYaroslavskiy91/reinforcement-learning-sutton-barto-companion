## What is this?
A companion for exercise solutions to serve as a read-along for Reinforcement Learning, by Sutton and Barton. This guide is meant to serve as additional material to assist those working through this text. Solutions to select problems exist and are detailed within. In order to address the programming exercises, RL solvers are created and utilized within. These are also used to recreate relevant plots found within the text.

## Reading guide
The reader (henceforth refered to as "you") is strongly encouraged to attempt the exercises on your own before browsing solutions, afterwhich there are multiple ways to read through these docs. The notebook and python files are available, though you are encouraged to explore the pdf and html versions.
